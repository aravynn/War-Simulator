Zombie Simulator Application

Application built in WinAPI in C++

Uses double buffering class code from https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/21426/Double-Buffering-in-a-Win32-API-Program

This code is intended to simulate a map of humans (blue) vs zombies(red) fighting over killing the other. 

Zombies convert humans while humans kill zombies. But, humans must also survive on food and use weapons. 

This project is IN DEVELOPMENT. It started as a simple project to get a better understanding of double buffering and using WinAPI. 

Needs completion: 
Needs more UI Development, should have sliders to control base levels (kill trations etc)
Need a complete logic overhaul for zombie and human movement. The current logic is abhorrently programmed and should be simplified, as it was programmed purely fore placeholder purposes.
Needs to have a simplification of visual appearance, as it is a little hectic while it runs. 

Where it stands: 
I'm currently leaving this as-is, since I'm looking to move onto other relevant projects, however I might come back to this in the future to play around with it more.

All the codde I've developed in this project is considered open-source, so go ahead and use at your pleasure. Drop me a line if you do, I'm interested to know if someone else completes this.
